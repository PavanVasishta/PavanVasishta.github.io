This model assumes that the environment perceived by pedestrians is composed of multiple potential fields that influence their behaviour. These fields are derived from static scene elements like side-walks, cross-walks, buildings, shops entrances and dynamic obstacles like cars and buses for instance. Using this model, autonomous cars increase their level of situational awareness in the local urban space, with the ability to infer probable pedestrian paths in the scene to predict, for example, legal and illegal crossings.","tags":null,"title":"Natural vision based method for predicting pedestrian behaviour in urban environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P Vasishta","D Vaufreydaz","A Spalanzani"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504216800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504216800,"objectID":"cd0c44bff883d0ae53e3153288a08900","permalink":"/publication/urban-behaviour-iros/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/urban-behaviour-iros/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Urban Pedestrian Behaviour Modelling using Natural Vision and Potential Fields","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461708000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461708000,"objectID":"c15c25756e18bd3e1bf5594c018a4560","permalink":"/project/traffic-junction-annotation/","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/project/traffic-junction-annotation/","section":"project","summary":"Pedestrian movement annotations on the Traffic Junction dataset.","tags":null,"title":"Annotations for the Traffic Anomaly Dataset","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" +++ title = \u0026ldquo;Building Prior Knowledge: A Markov Based Pedestrian Prediction Model Using Urban Environment Data\u0026rdquo; date = 2018-11-18T00:00:00 draft = false\nAuthors.

This high level of situational awareness requires observing pedestrian behavior and extrapolating their positions to know future positions. While some work has been done in this field using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), one of the few observed drawbacks of the method is the need for informed priors for learning behavior. In this work, an extension to the Growing Hidden Markov Model (GHMM) method is proposed to solve some of these drawbacks. This is achieved by building on existing work using potential cost maps and the principle of \\textit{Natural Vision}. As a consequence, the proposed model is able to predict pedestrian positions more precisely over a longer horizon compared to the state of the art. The method is tested over \u0026ldquo;legal\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;illegal\u0026rdquo; behavior of pedestrians, having trained the model with sparse observations and partial trajectories. The method, with no training data, is compared against a trained state of the art model. It is observed that the proposed method is robust even in new, previously unseen areas.\u0026rdquo; abstract_short = \u0026ldquo;\u0026rdquo;\nIs this a featured publication?
