During my PhD, I worked on understanding and predicting pedestrian behaviour around autonomous vehicles in built urban areas by building and exploiting prior knowledge. My research focused on using sociological ideas like Natural Vision as a basis for using probabilistic methods to predict pedestrian behaviour in urban areas. In this, I was aided by an ANR (Agence National de Recherche) grant for a collaborative project involving the research labs Inria Grenoble , Inria Paris, LS2N and the industrial partner AKKA.\nI completed my MSc from the Ecole Centrale de Nantes in Advanced Robotics and have worke on making collaborative robots safer around human operators as an intern at IRT Jules Verne.\nMy current research interests include potential fields, Natural Vision, Markov models, self-organizing topological maps, pedestrian prediction in urban areas and decision making under uncertainity.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I defended my PhD in September 2019 and currently on the lookout for new opportunities.\nMy CV can be found here (Updated Sept. 2019)\nPreviously, I was a PhD Candidate in the CHROMA team at Inria Grenoble under the supervision of Anne Spalanzani and Dominique Vaufreydaz.
